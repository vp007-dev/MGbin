# MGBin – Monkey Guard Smart Dustbin

**MGBin (Monkey Guard Bin)** is a smart, hybrid automation dustbin designed to prevent monkeys and other wildlife from accessing and scattering waste in urban, tourist and residential areas.  
It combines **IoT-based intelligence with mechanical fail-safe automation**, making it reliable, scalable and suitable for Smart City deployments.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In many Indian cities, monkeys and other wildlife frequently open traditional dustbins, scattering garbage across streets, parks and public places.  
This causes:

- Poor sanitation and unhygienic environments  
- Spread of diseases  
- Continuous cleaning costs  
- Human–animal conflict in residential and tourist zones  

Conventional bins provide **no protection against animal tampering**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

MGBin introduces a **hybrid automation system** that allows only humans to deposit waste while completely blocking animals from accessing it.

The system works in **two intelligent modes**:

### 1️⃣ Smart IoT Mode (Primary)
- An **ESP32-CAM** detects whether the approaching object is a **human or an animal (monkey)**.
- For humans → the flap **opens automatically** using a **gear motor**.
- For animals → the flap **remains locked**, preventing access.

### 2️⃣ Mechanical Gravity Mode (Fail-Safe)
- If sensors, power, or electronics are unavailable, the bin continues to function mechanically.
- A **pivoted gravity-balanced internal door** allows humans to deposit waste but stays locked against animal interference.

This ensures **100% operational reliability** even during power failure or remote deployments.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Dual-mode hybrid automation (IoT + Mechanical)  
- ESP32-CAM based animal/human detection  
- Automatic flap control using gear motor  
- Gravity-based fail-safe mechanical design  
- Weather-resistant and tamper-proof build  
- Low maintenance and long operational life  
- Cost-effective and scalable manufacturing  

---

## 🔁 How It Works

    1. A person approaches the bin  
    2. ESP32-CAM analyzes object type  
    3. If human → motor opens flap  
    4. Waste is deposited  
    5. Flap auto-locks again  
    6. If animal detected → flap remains locked  
    7. In power failure → gravity mechanism allows human-only disposal

## 🧠 Automation Logic

| Detection | Action | Result |
|---------|------|------|
| Human detected | Motor opens flap | Trash accepted |
| Animal detected | Flap locked | Access denied |
| No power | Mechanical pivot door works | Manual human access |

## 🔒 Animal Blocking Logic
```text
Animal tries to access → Door remains locked → No leverage / no grip → Access denied → Garbage stays inside
